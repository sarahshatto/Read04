## CH 4 LINKS (p 74-93)

* Links are created using the a element.

* The a element uses HREF attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.￼

* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs. 

* You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the “to” field. 

* You can use the Id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to. ￼

CH 15 LAYOUT (p 358- 404), (core concepts 358-364)

* Div elements are often used as a containing elements to group together sections of a page.

* Browsers display pages in a normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning. 

* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. Floated items require a defined width. 

* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (responsive) layouts. 

* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicates what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling) 

* Grids help create professional and flexible designs. 

* Css frameworks provide rules for common tasks. 

* You can include multiple css files in one page. 

### JS BOOK (pg 86-99) 

* Programmers use Functions and methods and objects to organize their code.

* Functions and methods: functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task. 

* A method is the same as a function, except methods are created inside an object.￼

* Objects: made up of properties and methods.￼

* Built in objects: The browser comes with a set of objects that act like a tool kit for creating interactive webpages.

#### Functions: 

* Grouping together the statements that are required to answer a question or perform a task helps organize your code.￼￼￼

* You don’t have to run the statements in a function when the page first loads- functions offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task. 

* The script can then ask the function to perform all of those steps as and when they are required. (Ex when someone clicks) 

* If you’re going to ask the function to perform a task later, you need to give your functioning name. That name should describe the task it is performing. When you ask it to performance task it is known as calling the function.

￼ *  The steps at the function needs to perform in order to performance task are packaged up in a code block. The code black consists of one or more statements contained within curly braces. And you don’t add a semicolon after the closing curly brace like you would after a statement.
